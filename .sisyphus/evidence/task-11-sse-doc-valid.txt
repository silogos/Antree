# SSE Event Mapping Documentation

Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time queue session system updates. This document describes all event types, endpoints, and payload structures for the session-based queue system.

## Overview

The SSE system provides real-time updates for queue sessions and items. Clients can subscribe to specific sessions or items to receive live updates when changes occur.

**Important:** All event payloads use `snake_case` property names per project convention.

## Session Events

Emitted when a new queue session is created.

**Payload:**
```json
